​Hangman

​
How is this game played?

-a request to an Api will be sent to get an array of random words

-a random word will be picked, based on the difficulty, 4 letters 7 letters or 10 letters;

-span elements will be created based on the length of the words

-element with all the alphabet letters will be on the screen and the player will be able to click them

-the player will try to guess the letters of the word by clicking on the alphabet letters:
         -if the letter is in the word it will be shown
         -if not a body element will be shown

-if the whole body will be shown the player lose

-if the player guess the whole word before the whole body will hang wins



there will be a section of the screen where the body will hang. Not sure if it will be a body or a word.

Can be a sentence showing up a little everytime, like something... "You Lose" showing one letter at the time every time the player doesn't guess.

That will be my challenge, try to learn how the animations work.
